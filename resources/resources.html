                <p class="resources.advice2"> Always check if the company or event you're signing up for has received your form. Apparently, there was an error in the system and my contact info was messed up. Everything was fixed in the end tho :) -jason@coloryourcommunity </p>
                <p class="resources.adivce3"> Tell your friends about this website too! My friends and I needed community service hours for school but we didn't know where to go. Thank goodness someone told us about Color your Community.
                   Also, if you're interested in an event and intent to go, sign up ASAP because free slots fill up pretty quicky - daniel@coloryourcommunity</p>
