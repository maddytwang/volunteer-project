    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <h3> IMPACT:</h3>
    <p>Our website gives users the means of tracking and logging their volunteer hours.
      Additionally, we have a calendar that shows the days that the volunteer has played
      an active part in changing the lives around them. This allows them to see the impact
      they are making on the community. </p>
    <h3> OPPORTUNITIES:</h3>
    <p>We provide multiple opportunities for volunteers to give back and make a difference.
      A list of organizations in California as well as abroad is present on our website to
      give users the option of connecting with the community no matter where they go.</p>
    <h3> COMMUNITY:</h3>
    <p>We strive to bring people together and create bonds within one another. Through every
      contribution one makes, we believe it is a step to a closer and stronger community. </p>
